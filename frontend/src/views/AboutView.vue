      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <p>
        This entire project was created by GROUP4. It took 15 days of hard work and dedication to build a fully
        functional Travelog website. We put in countless hours to ensure that
        every aspect of the website is perfect and provides the best user
        experience possible.
